      <h4>About Me:</h4>
      <p>Hi I'm Snowball, and I'm ready to find my furever home. I have been pretty shy here at the shelter, but am really starting to come out of my shell. I can be fearful in new environments and around new people, so I am looking for a home that can help build my confidence. I am treat motivated and enjoy playing with toys.</p>

      <h4>About Me:</h4>
      <p>My name is Harper I have never met an activity I did not like! If you love exercise and keeping active, then we will be fast friends. I will go for a run in the morning, a hike in the afternoon, play fetch in the evening, and unwind with some play at home before bed - and I would love nothing more than to have someone who can keep up with me. It is important that I have an outlet for my boundless energy, so let us get together and explore the outdoors!</p>

      <h4>About Me:</h4>
      <p>My name is Minnie and I'm looking for new home. I am a very sweet girl once I get to know you, but I can be fearful in new environments and around new people. The person that found me said that I got along with her dogs, cats, and goats. Unfortunately, she did not get along with the chickens and will need a home without them. I can also be protective of my people and will need an adult only home. I am very treat motivated and it doesn't take me long to feel comfortable when treats are involved. If you think we would make a great match, please come and meet me today!</p>

      <p>Hi I'm Marsha. A fun and exuberant girl looking for my new home. I enjoy the company of humans, but I mostly would love to have toys to play with. I love toys! Sometimes I get a little obsessed with them, but what dog wouldn't?! If you have been looking for a more independent pup I am your gal! I do need some training how to walk nicely on leash, and other commands (I know sit so far). Kids in the home need to be over the age of 12. Ask to meet me!</p>
